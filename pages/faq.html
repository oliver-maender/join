                                A kanban board is a graphical user interface for living the kanban principle.
                                At first, you create a ticket with all relevant information and store it in the
                                backlog.
                                When your team members and you want to start to work on the task, you can push it to the
                                board.
                                The task goes through four states: to do, in progress, testing and done.
                                Every team member can see the task's working status and push it to the next state until
                                it's
                                done.

                                Press "Add Task" at the navigation bar to see the graphical user interface. Fill out the

                                In the backlog and on the board every task has a specific color. Every color stands for a
                                category (e.g. department/division) which is defined when creating a new task.
                                Therefore, team members can recognize faster if the task is within their area of
                                expertise
                                and accordingly relevant for them to be handled.

                                board. A
                                new dialog will open with more detailed information about the task.
                                Just press the
